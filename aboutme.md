Italian physicist, living in Germany as Data Scientist. Passionate about data, feminism and horses

### My story in a few bullet point

- Born in Italy in 1991

- Said the word "Horse" before saying "Mama"

- Wanted to become a soldier or a priest because girls were not supposed to be part of the Army or the Church. Grrrlz Power!

- But this was before understanding that I don't like either the Army or the Church

- Grown up as a Physicist (Particle Physicist, to be precise)

- After Master Degree, went to Hamburg for a (failing) PhD in Physics

- Now a Data Scientist since 2019 with ongoing projects

- Stay tuned for the next bullet point
